		<h2>This Is My First Blog Post</h2>
		<h3>December 25, 2013</h3>
		<p>
		The hot apps at this years SXSW festival were the proximity awareness apps, which use geo-tagging to help you discover the people around you. Glancee and Highlight are thus far the two most popular apps in this category, although Highlight is the clear winner in my opinion. Over the coming months I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of these apps roll out and while Highlight has made some big steps in the right directions, I believe the app that leverages professional connections, as opposed to personal when making recommendations, will realize the full potential of these apps.
